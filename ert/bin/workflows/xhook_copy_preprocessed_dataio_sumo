-- This workflow is intended to be run as a HOOK workflow.
-- This workflow job is locally installed, from ert/bin/jobs.

-- Arguments:
-- ert_caseroot (Path): The absolute path to the root of the case on /scratch
-- ert_configpath (Path): The absolute path to the ERT config ies project disk revision
-- inpath (str): Folder relative to ert_configpath, e.g. ../../share/preprocessed

-- Optional arguments:
-- --verbosity (str): Python logging level to use
-- --global_variables_path(str): Rel. path to global variables (may also be an ENV?)
--
-- NOTE! If using optional arguments, note that the "--" annotation will be interpreted
-- as comments by ERT if not wrapped in quotes. This is the syntax to use:
-- (existing arguments) "--verbosity" DEBUG

-- The workflow name is prefixed "xhook" to signal that even if it appears in the ERT
-- workflow dropdown, it is not supposed to be ran by the user. Also, the "x" in front
-- makes it go to the bottom of the drop-down. When having many HOOK workflows, it is
-- annoying that they take up a lot of space in the ERT dropdown. This is NOT the case
-- in Drogon, with very few workflows, but the routine is useful for setups in the wild.
